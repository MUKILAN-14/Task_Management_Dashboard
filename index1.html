                <h2>What is a Task Management Dashboard ?</h2> 
                A task management dashboard is a digital tool that helps you organize, track, and prioritize your tasks. It provides a visual representation of your to-do list, deadlines, and progress, all in one place. With a well-designed dashboard, you can easily see what needs to be done, allocate time for each task, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.It centralizes all task-related information, providing a clear and concise overview of what needs to be done, who is responsible for each task, and the progress of ongoing projects.
